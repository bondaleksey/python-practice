- DRY -> use functions and loops 
- don't use "magic numbers" -> use constants
- delete Commented-Out Code and Dead Code
- use loggings instead of "print(This)"
- use variables with numeric suffixes only if numbers is part of name like in `IPv6`
- be careful with Classes That Should Just Be Functions or Modules
- use list comprehensions, but don’t go overboard and nest them within each other
- avoid empty except Blocks and Poor error Messages
